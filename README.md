Progressive Web Apps - Overview  
======================================  
  
Open definition created by Google and embraced today by most companies.  
  
    - App built with web technologies  
    - It works fast while online or offline  
    - It can be installed on different platforms  
Ideal for all those apps that consume web content and web services.  
  
App Development Approaches  
--------------------------  
- Native SDKs  - Create Experience for one device 
-  Web Development - Browser .PWA lands here.  
- Hybrid Development  

Using PWA we can use app for browser and app for Device as well with the  
web technologies.  
  
Characteristics of PWA  
----------------------  
  
1.Multi Platform Support.(Works with browser, Mobile Devices and  
2.Desktops(Outside browser))  
  
The PWA takes best of two worlds(Web and Native),  
  
### From Web  
    ⁃ Links and Discoverability 
    ⁃ Easy to Deploy.  
    ⁃ Easy to Update  
    ⁃ Standards and Tools  
### From Native  
    ⁃ Offline Access  
    ⁃ Installed icons and Stand alone  
    ⁃ Push Notifications  
    ⁃ Performance and UX  
### Web Advantages for Development  
	 ⁃ Web frameworks  
	 ⁃ Web APIs  
	 ⁃ Human Resources and Skills  
	 ⁃ Web SDKs  
When to use the Platform  
------------------------  
  
### Your Web Experience into App world  
  
    ⁃ You are a web developer  
    ⁃ Your team's know how is mainly on web development  
    ⁃ You don't have any native app development experience  
    ⁃ You want to create an installed app experience for your users  
    ⁃ Then create PWA  
### Corporate Apps  
  
    ⁃ You create corporate internal app.  
    ⁃ You want to increase user engagement  
    ⁃ You want your app to work offline You need multi plat form and fast deply.  
    ⁃ Then use PWA  
### Current Website  
  
    ⁃ You already have a website or web app  
    ⁃ you have active users  
    ⁃ You want to increase engagement and conversion rates  
    ⁃ Upgrade your web site into PWA  
### App and Website  
  
    ⁃ You have new webiste and app in store  
    ⁃ User in many countries can't install your native apps.  
    ⁃ Slow networks, low end devices and privacy concerns  
    ⁃ Then Creatte PWA  
### Outdated App in Store  
  
    ⁃ You have a native app in the store  
    ⁃ You don't have a team to keep it updated.  
    ⁃ Its outdated compared with new native platforms.  
    ⁃ It outdated with new web.  
    ⁃ Then use PWA  
The PWA Criteria  
----------------  
  
Progressive Web App is a design pattern for the web.  
  
### Three Main Components of a PWA  
  
	  ⁃ Web app  
	  ⁃ Service worker  
	  ⁃ App distribution (Web app manifest)  
### Progressive Web App Instability Criteria  
  
	  ⁃ App meta data is present.  
	  ⁃ Service worker is installed.  
	  ⁃ App works offline  
	  ⁃ App is fast  
### PWA Development Mode  
  
	  ⁃ Single Page Application  
	  ⁃ Multiple Page Application  
PWA Scope  
---------  
Its an origin and path that defines where our PWA resides;for example  
domain.app or domain.com/app If the page requests outside the PWA scope,  
then it will render the request in app browser.  
  
P for Progressive Enhancement  
-----------------------------  
Strategy for web design that emphasizes core webpage content first and  
then progressively adds layers of features as the end-user's  
browser/internet connection allow.  
  
### Progressive Features  
  
	  ⁃ Basic web content  
	  ⁃ Add installation  
	  ⁃ Add service worker  
	  ⁃ Add hardware usage  
### Progressive Experience  
  
	  ⁃ React to different environments.  
	  ⁃ Offer a good experience for all users.  
	  ⁃ Same code delivering different levels of quality.  
	  ⁃ Use APIs to detect environment and act in consequence.  
### The Icons  
  
After the PWA is installed, the icon will look like the one from any app  
in that OS
 
### Abilities  
  
	  ⁃ The Web Platform (Web Assembly, WebGL, AR/VR, WebPush, WebShare, WebAuthn, Payment Request, GamePad, WebRTC, Web Bluetooth, MediaRecorder, Machine Learning, Sensors and geolocation, Communication with other nartivae apps.)  
	  ⁃ API Support (Progressive Enhancement, Extending the web with native SDKs  
### Limitations  
  
	  ⁃ Web Platform (Not every native API is exposed)  
	  ⁃ Background execution  ⁃ Geofencing, BLE neacons  
	  ⁃ Low-level handling  ⁃ Bugs and lacks of documentation  
	  ⁃ HTTPS required for some abilities.  
	  ⁃ Platform Awareness  
	  ⁃ Business owner don't understand.
